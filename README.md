# NTS x BandCamp URL finder

A simple script to list BandCamp URLs for NTS shows. Will think about making a plugin now.

## Usage

Clone this git repo, then create a python virtual environment. Install the script dependencies with

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

then you can use the command like so

`python3 main.py https://www.nts.live/shows/ok-williams/episodes/ok-williams-17th-february-2022`

This script only works with direct links to individual episodes
